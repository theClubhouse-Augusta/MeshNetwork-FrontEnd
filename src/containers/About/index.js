                  Collaborative Incubators are community driven spaces to grow
                  innovation, learning, and venture creation. There are several
                  models with different focuses. These models include
                  Makerspaces, Coworking Spaces, Business Incubators.

                  Most of our success is the result of the connections we have

                  organizers grow larger communities, and helps connect
                  entrepreneurs to resources across a much larger network.
